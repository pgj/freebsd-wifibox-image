# Wifibox Virtual Machine Images

This repository is to hold the virtual machine images for the
[wifibox project](https://github.com/pgj/freebsd-wifibox).  The image is
based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) and is meant to be used
with [bhyve](https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve).

Note that the images are not stored in this repository but as attachments
for each releases.
