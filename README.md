# Wifibox Virtual Machine Images

*Please note that the repository and its attachments are not updated
any more.  They have been replaced by
[`freebsd-wifibox-alpine`](https://github.com/pgj/freebsd-wifibox-alpine),
which is used by the [`net/wifibox-alpine`
port](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/log/net/wifibox-alpine/).*

This repository is to hold the virtual machine images for the [wifibox
project](https://github.com/pgj/freebsd-wifibox).  The image is based
on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) and is meant to be used
with [bhyve](https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve).

Note that the images are not stored in this repository but as
attachments for each releases.
